# PCA Implementation from Scratch - Global Health Indicators Analysis

## Project Overview
This project implements Principal Component Analysis (PCA) from scratch using only NumPy, applied to a comprehensive global health indicators dataset. The implementation demonstrates advanced linear algebra concepts including eigendecomposition, covariance analysis, and dimensionality reduction on real-world health data.
